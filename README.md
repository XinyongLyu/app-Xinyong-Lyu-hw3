Allow the user to provide information in the text boxes
When the user clicks Submit, use JavaScript to validate the fields. None of the fields can be empty. 
If a field is empty, display a message "First Name cannot be empty" replacing "First Name" with appropriate field label. You can display one message at a time. This text should appear in RED. 
If all fields are not empty, display a message, "Validation successful". This text should appear in GREEN. 
To begin with, the message field should be empty.
Push your code to a "public" repository on GitHub ("private" repositories cannot be published as a web site).
On GitHub, go to your repository, click on "Settings", scroll down to "Github Pages",  and under "Source", select "master" branch. Your web site is now published. Scroll down to Github Pages to find the URL.
